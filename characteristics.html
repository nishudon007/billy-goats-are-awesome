	<h2>Size</h2>
<p>There are two different height standards for the Nigerian Dwarf goat. The height standard maintained by the American Goat Society and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Dairy_Goat_Association">American Dairy Goat Association</a> requires does to be less than 22.5 inches (57 <abbr title="centimeters">cm</abbr>) at the withers, and bucks to be less than 23.5 inches (60 <abbr title="centimeters">cm</abbr>) at the withers. The Nigerian Dwarf Goat Association states does should ideally be 17–19 inches (43–48 <abbr title="centimeters">cm</abbr>) in height, with a maximum allowed height of 21 inches (53 <abbr title="centimeters">cm</abbr>), and bucks should ideally be 19–21 inches (48–53 <abbr title="centimeters">cm</abbr>), with a maximum allowed height of 23 inches (58 <abbr title="centimeters">cm</abbr>).</p>
	<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>They come in many colors: white, black, gold, red, cream and patterns such as buckskin (brown with a black cape over the head and neck along with other black markings) and chamoisee <em>similar to an Oberhasli goat</em>, with or without white spots. Some have white "frosting" on the ears. Both the Nigerian Dwarf Goat Association and the American Goat Society websites feature pages that include color descriptions, disqualifying features and conformation. Although most are naturally horned, generally breeders disbud them at a young age (usually less than 2 weeks of age) for safety to the goat, its herd mates, and human caregivers[citation needed]. Some Nigerian Dwarf goats have blue eyes, which is a dominant trait in goats.</p>
